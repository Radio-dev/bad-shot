how to download bad shot

not for school!

Download Python:

Visit the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Download the latest version of Python (Python 3.x) for your operating system (Windows).
Run the installer and make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" before clicking "Install Now".
Install Pygame:

Open the Command Prompt (Windows key + R, then type cmd and press Enter).
In the Command Prompt, type the following command and press Enter:
Copy code
pip install pygame
This will install Pygame on your system, which is required to run the game.
Download and Set Up the Game:

Go to the folder where the "Bad Shot" game files are located.
Look for the "bad shot" folder containing the game’s Python files.
Copy the "bad shot" folder into C:\Program Files (x86) 
Create a Shortcut:

Inside the "bad shot" folder, locate the main Python script (often named something like badshot.py).
Right-click the Python script and select "Create Shortcut".
Drag the shortcut to your Desktop.
Run the Game:

To run the game, double-click the shortcut on your Desktop.
If everything is set up correctly, the game will open and you can start playing.
Troubleshooting:

If you get an error about missing Python or missing Pygame, make sure that you’ve installed Python 3.x and Pygame properly, and that they are added to your system’s PATH.
You can check if Python is installed by typing python --version in the Command Prompt.
You can check if Pygame is installed by typing python -m pygame.examples.aliens in the Command Prompt (this should run a small test game if Pygame is working).
